# Ops Automation Playbook

_Last updated: 2025-11-08 (UTC)_

This guide explains how to run the nightly smoke captures and weekly latency rollups
specified in PLAN §22 using the shared CLI + automation scripts.

## Nightly Smoke Run

```
uv run python scripts/run_smoke.py \
  --date $(date -u +%Y-%m-%d) \
  --http2 \
  --poll-interval 1.0 \
  --timeout 900 \
  --seed 0 \
  --category docs_articles \
  --category dashboards_apps
```

- Add `--dry-run` when you want to exercise the pipeline without hitting `/jobs`
  (useful before the API is live or when secrets are unavailable). Pair it with
  `--seed <int>` (defaults to 0) so synthetic manifests remain deterministic.
  Dry runs still write manifests, summary markdown, and weekly stats so downstream
  tooling can be tested.
- Use `--category <name>` (repeatable) to scope the run to specific categories from
  `benchmarks/production_set.json`. This is useful when a particular slice is flaky
  and you want to rerun it without exercising the entire set.

- Loads `benchmarks/production_set.json` (docs/articles, dashboards/apps,
  lightweight pages) and runs each URL via `scripts/olmocr_cli.py`.
- Stores outputs under `benchmarks/production/<DATE>/<category>/<timestamp_slug>/`.
  Each directory contains `manifest.json`, `out.md`, `links.json`, and the tile
  PNGs under `artifact/`.
- Writes a daily `manifest_index.json` aggregating the job IDs, budgets, and timing data,
  plus `summary.md` (Markdown table with per-category budgets vs. observed p95 capture/total).
  The latest run is always mirrored into:
  - `benchmarks/production/latest.txt` (date stamp)
  - `benchmarks/production/latest_manifest_index.json`
  - `benchmarks/production/latest_summary.md`
  so dashboards/automation can point at a stable path.
- Run `uv run python scripts/show_latest_smoke.py --manifest --metrics --weekly` to inspect
  the latest summary/manifest pointers plus the rolling `weekly_summary.json`. The CLI now
  highlights categories that exceed their p95 budgets and accepts `--limit` to trim the manifest
  table. Set `MDWB_SMOKE_ROOT=/path/to/runs` (or pass `--root`) if the pointer files live outside
  `benchmarks/production/`, and add `--json` when automation needs structured output instead of tables.
- For automation/health checks, run `uv run python scripts/show_latest_smoke.py check --root benchmarks/production`
  (add `--no-weekly` if you only care about summary/manifest/metrics). The command exits non-zero when any
  required pointer file is missing, making it suitable for CI/dashboards.

### Prerequisites
- `/jobs` API available on `API_BASE_URL` with credentials in `.env`.
- Chrome for Testing pin + Playwright version recorded in `manifest.json`.
- Enough quota on the hosted olmOCR endpoint for the nightly workload.

### Verification Checklist
1. `scripts/run_checks.sh` (ruff → ty → Playwright smoke) passes before the smoke run.
2. Each category report stays below its p95 latency budget (see `manifest_index.json`).
3. Failures must be triaged immediately; rerun `scripts/olmocr_cli.py run` on the
   offending URL with `--out-dir benchmarks/reruns` for deeper debugging.

## Weekly Latency Summary

`scripts/run_smoke.py` automatically refreshes `benchmarks/production/weekly_summary.json`
by folding the last seven days of `manifest_index.json` entries. The file contains:

- `generated_at`: ISO timestamp.
- `window_days`: currently 7.
- `categories`: list of `{name, runs, budget_ms, capture_ms.{p50,p95}, total_ms.{p50,p95}}`.

Run `uv run python scripts/show_latest_smoke.py --weekly --manifest --metrics --no-summary`
to review the latest weekly summary alongside the pointer files (set
`MDWB_SMOKE_ROOT` or `--root` if the artifacts live outside `benchmarks/production/`). The CLI
highlights categories whose p95 totals exceed their budgets so you can spot regressions
before publishing the Monday report. Append `--json` when you need the payload for dashboards/CI.

Publish the summary in Monday’s ops update and attach the most recent
`benchmarks/production/<DATE>/manifest_index.json` for traceability.

## Troubleshooting
- **API unreachable**: make sure `API_BASE_URL` resolves from the machine running the
  script; set `MDWB_API_KEY` if the deployment requires auth.
- **Typer CLI partial exits (code 10)**: inspect the job directory for `manifest.json`
  and `links.json` to see where OCR failed; re-run with `--timeout` bumped if tiles
  are still streaming.
- **OCR throttling**: temporarily reduce `OCR_MAX_CONCURRENCY` in `.env` and rerun,
  then notify the hosted OCR contact listed in `docs/olmocr_cli.md`.

## Warning & Blocklist Logs

- Every capture that emits warnings or blocklist hits appends a JSON line to
  `WARNING_LOG_PATH` (defaults to `ops/warnings.jsonl`). The record includes the job ID,
  URL, warning list, blocklist hits, sweep stats, and `validation_failures` so incidents
  can be triaged without scraping manifests.
- Use the CLI helper `uv run python scripts/mdwb_cli.py warnings tail --count 50 --json`
  (add `--follow` to stream, or `--log-path` to override the default) to review recent entries.
  When `--follow` is set the CLI now waits for the log to appear and automatically recovers from
  truncation/logrotate events, so long-lived tails keep running overnight. The pretty output
  summarizes warning codes, blocklist selectors, sweep overlap ratios, and validation failures
  so ops can spot duplicate seams or retries immediately.
- Job watchers (`mdwb fetch --watch`, `mdwb jobs watch`, `mdwb demo stream`) print the same
  sweep/blocklist/validation summaries whenever manifests expose those fields, so noisy runs
  surface the breadcrumbs even without tailing the log.
- Rotate/ship the log via your usual log aggregation tooling; the file is plain JSONL
  and safe to ingest into Loki/Elastic/GCS.

## Automation Hooks
- Schedule the nightly job via cron or the CI runner (e.g., 02:00 UTC) and archive
  the resulting `benchmarks/production/<DATE>` directory as a build artifact.
- Use the weekly summary JSON to feed Grafana/Metabase until we switch to direct
  metrics ingestion.
- GitHub Actions example: `.github/workflows/nightly_smoke.yml` installs uv/Playwright,
  writes a minimal `.env` from repository secrets (`MDWB_API_BASE_URL`, `MDWB_API_KEY`,
  `OLMOCR_SERVER`, `OLMOCR_API_KEY`), runs `scripts/check_env.py` to fail fast on misconfigurations,
  then executes `scripts/run_smoke.py --date ${{ steps.dates.outputs.today }}`,
  and uploads `benchmarks/production/<DATE>` as an artifact.

## API CLI Helpers

- Use `uv run python scripts/mdwb_cli.py demo snapshot` (or `demo stream`/`demo events`) to
  interact with the built-in `/jobs/demo` endpoints. The CLI automatically reads
  `API_BASE_URL` and `MDWB_API_KEY` from `.env`, so authenticated deployments just need
  the secrets filled in once.
- The CLI now enforces the required `.env` keys (`API_BASE_URL`, `OLMOCR_SERVER`,
  `OLMOCR_MODEL`, `OLMOCR_API_KEY`) via `_required_config()`. If one is missing it fails
  fast with a clear error—fill in `.env` (or pass `--api-base/--server`) before rerunning.
- Webhook helpers: `mdwb jobs webhooks list`, `... add`, and the new `... delete --id/--url`
  manage `/jobs/{id}/webhooks` without hand-written curl calls.
- Override the API base temporarily via `--api-base https://staging.mdwb.internal`
  if you need to target a different environment.
- `uv run python scripts/mdwb_cli.py watch <job-id>` streams the human-friendly
  view on `/jobs/{id}/events` (state/progress/warnings) and automatically falls
  back to the SSE stream if the NDJSON endpoint is unavailable. Pass
  `--raw/--since/--interval` to align with automation requirements.
- The Events tab/CLI watchers now show blocklist, sweep, and validation events emitted
  directly by the SSE feed, so the new manifest breadcrumbs surface even when the
  Manifest tab isn’t open.
- `uv run python scripts/mdwb_cli.py events <job-id> --follow` tails the raw
  `/jobs/{id}/events` NDJSON feed for pipelines; combine with `--since` to resume
  from the last timestamp when running in cron or CI.
- `uv run python scripts/mdwb_cli.py jobs webhooks list <job-id>` / `... add ...` / `... delete ...`
  lets agents inspect/manage webhook callbacks per PLAN §4 without issuing manual
  curl requests; repeat `--event` to subscribe to additional job states.
